# DonationApp

Client-Server Application with Hibernate ORM

This project is a client-server application designed to facilitate seamless communication between a client interface and a backend server.

Client Layer: A user-friendly front-end interface for donations. An user can log in as volunteer, and he can register donations for different charity cases. <br>
Server Layer: A robust backend that processes requests from the client, handles business logic, and ensures secure data transactions.
Technologies Used:
- Frontend:  JavaFX
- Backend: Java + SpringBoot for RESTful API
- Database: SQL-Lite
- Hibernate ORM: For object-relational mapping and database interactions (separate rest-services module for future implementation of rest architecture) <br>
Key Features:
- Client-Server Communication – RESTful API or WebSocket for real-time updates
- Hibernate ORM Integration – Simplifies database operations and ensures data consistency
